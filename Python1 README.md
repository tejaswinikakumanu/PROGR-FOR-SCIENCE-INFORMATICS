Assignment 2 | Introduction to Python 
Programmer: Tejaswini Kakumanu  
Language Used: Python  
Date: 28th September 2025  

Project Overview  
This project includes a Python script designed to process a DNA sequence file for human chromosome 1 secondary assembly (chr1_GL383518v1_alt). The program performs the following tasks:

- Reads and parses the DNA sequence from a FASTA file.
- Extracts specific nucleotides from the sequence at given positions.
- Generates the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
- Creates a nested dictionary to count nucleotide occurrences in each kilobase (1000 bp) segment.
- Analyzes nucleotide counts per kilobase, including summations and reporting discrepancies.

Prerequisites  
- Python 3 installed on your system.  
- Input FASTA file named 'chr1_GL383518v1_alt (1).fa' placed in the same directory as the script.

How to Run the Script  
1. Save the Python script as Assignment_2.py in your working directory.  
2. Ensure the FASTA file ('chr1_GL383518v1_alt (1).fa') is in the same folder.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script and FASTA file using the cd command.  
5. Run the script by typing:
